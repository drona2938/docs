# Drip Campaigns

Modified on **Fri, 18 Oct, 2024 at 3:06 PM**

## Important Notice: Complying with Meta's 24-Hour Rule for Drip Campaigns

Meta, the parent company of Facebook Messenger, enforces a **24-hour rule** for promotional messaging. This regulation applies to any marketing or promotional messages delivered through Messenger, a core component of Chatbotbuilder.ai.

### Key Takeaway:

You can only send promotional messages to users who have interacted with your business within the past **24 hours** on Messenger. Interactions include:

- Subscribing to your bot
- Clicking on a button
- Initiating a conversation

**Failing to comply** with this rule can result in limitations on your ability to send messages through Messenger.

## What Are Drip Campaigns?

Drip campaigns are a marketing powerhouse, allowing you to nurture leads, engage customers, and ultimately drive conversions. By delivering automated sequences of personalized messages, you can build relationships with your audience and keep your brand top-of-mind.

This guide will equip you with the knowledge to create effective drip campaigns within **Chatbotbuilder.ai**. We'll walk you through the process step-by-step, from crafting compelling content to scheduling your messages and setting up the all-important subscription flow.

## Steps to Create Drip Campaigns

### 1\. Craft Your Compelling Flows

Imagine your drip campaign as a series of personalized messages spread over time. Start by designing individual **chatbot flows** for each stage of your campaign. These flows will contain the content you want to deliver at specific intervals.

Here’s an example:

- **Day 1 Flow**: Welcome new subscribers, introduce your brand, and offer a special discount.
- **Day 3 Flow**: Provide valuable content related to your niche and highlight a relevant product or service.
- **Day 7 Flow**: Share customer testimonials or case studies to build trust and encourage conversions.

Each flow can include text messages, images, buttons, or even interactive elements like quizzes or polls to keep your audience engaged.

### 2\. Navigate to Drip Campaigns

To start setting up your drip sequence:

1. Go to the **Marketing** section.
2. Locate **Drip Campaigns** and click on it.

---

### 3\. Build Your Drip Campaign

To create a new drip campaign:

1. Click the **Add** button.
2. Give your campaign a clear and descriptive name, such as "**Welcome Series**" or "**New Product Launch**."
3. Click **Continue** to proceed.

---

### 4\. Schedule Your Messages

This is where you define the order and timing of your drip messages.

1. Click on **Message** to design your drip sequence.
2. For each message, select the flow you want to send (e.g., "Day 1 Flow").
3. Choose the delivery time (e.g., "Immediately").
4. Repeat this step for subsequent messages (Day 2, Day 3, etc.), selecting the appropriate flows and scheduling their delivery times.

> **Note**: The Day 1 flow will be sent immediately after the user subscribes to the drip campaign. The Day 2 flow will be sent one day after the Day 1 flow, and so on.

---

### 5\. Create a Subscription Flow

The **subscription flow** acts as the entry point for your drip campaign, prompting users to sign up.

1. Design a dedicated flow where users can subscribe.
2. Within this flow, use the **Subscribe to Drip Campaign** action.
3. Choose the drip campaign you just created from the dropdown menu.

---

## Putting it All Together

Once a user interacts with your subscription flow, they will be automatically enrolled in your drip campaign. The system will trigger the **Day 1** flow immediately, followed by the subsequent flows according to the schedule you've set.

---

## Bonus Tip: Personalize Your Drip Campaigns

Chatbotbuilder.ai allows you to **personalize** your drip campaign messages based on user actions and behavior. This way, you can deliver more relevant content and offers, increasing engagement and conversions.

For example, you could send targeted messages to users who have shown interest in a specific product category.

## Best Practices for Meta’s 24-Hour Rule

To ensure your drip campaigns comply with Meta’s regulations, consider these best practices:

1. **Design an engaging subscription flow** that encourages users to interact with your bot.
2. **Segment your audience** based on recent interactions and target promotional messages only to those who have opted in within the past 24 hours.
3. **Provide valuable content** and helpful information in your initial messages to build trust and foster continued engagement.

## Expanding Your Reach Beyond Messenger

While Meta’s 24-hour rule applies to **Facebook Messenger**, **Chatbotbuilder.ai** offers a distinct advantage: **omnichannel marketing**.

By leveraging **Chatbotbuilder.ai’s** integrations with other communication channels like **Telegram**, **SMS**, **Email**, and **Webchat**, you can extend your drip campaign reach beyond the limitations of Messenger’s 24-hour window.

This allows you to nurture leads and engage customers across various platforms, maximizing your marketing potential while adhering to individual platform guidelines.

> **Note**: Drip campaigns do not apply to phone calls, as they offer direct and immediate communication with your customers.
