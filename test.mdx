<Info>
  Functions provide a means to seamlessly integrate ChatGPT with your automation tools and external systems. These Functions enable you to effortlessly gather user information and initiate predefined flows. The triggered flow has the capability to execute various automations, retrieve data from external sources, and relay the information back to ChatGPT.

  Fliqr AI has included a pre-configured trigger that allows the user to stop bot automation and talk with a human agent. This Function is already active on all accounts.

## Naming and Description

<Tip>
  **Name**

  The best practice is to Name your Function in a way that it allows you, and others, to know exactly what it does at first sight. For example, instead of using “weather” as a name, use “get_current_weather”. 

  **Tip**: Always include a verb in the name (book, get, set) and avoid any special characters such as: ', &, á or ñ.

  **What Does This Trigger Do?**

  This field should clarify even more what the purpose of the Function is. Always start with “Allows the user to …”. For example, “Allows the user to book an appointment.”
